# Layer Bluefin

This is a simple uBlue image that takes vanilla Bluefin DX and layers some gaming packages, that benefit from having full system access. This is an opinionated list, with Faugus Launcher as the main Proton-GE manager and game launcher.

The following aliases are included to make it easy to run sandboxed games. Optimized for 1080p displays. Note: `%command%` is required after the alias to launch on Steam.

- `play` - Run a game in gamescope with mangohud and gamemode turned on.
- `play-fsr` - Same as above, but upscales the graphics via FSR.
- `play-int` - Same as above, but runs lower-res games pixel perfect.
